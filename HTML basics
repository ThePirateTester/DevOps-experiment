An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and an end tag, with the content inserted in between:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
eg:
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

Tags *SHOULD* be closed, but if not the page *SHOULD* handle it. closed by adding / inside the tag. eg: </h1>

If the element is empty, it doesn't need to be closed.

The <head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
